**Bloom D** is a Flutter-based plant care tracking application designed as part of the SOEN 357: User Interface Design course at Concordia University. The app helps users manage and monitor their houseplants through an interactive dashboard, detailed plant profiles, daily task checklists, and personalized recommendations. The intuitive interface is designed to encourage consistent plant care and promote a healthy, green environment.

## Features

- **Dashboard:**
  - **My Plants:** A horizontally scrollable list of your plants.
  - **Today's Tasks:** A checklist with tasks such as watering and checking soil.
  - **Grow the Family:** Suggestions and recommendations for expanding your plant collection.
  - **Custom AppBar:** A minimal header featuring the Bloom logo (tappable to return to the dashboard) and a profile icon.
  
- **Plant Detail Page:**
  - Detailed plant profile including a large image, plant description, health profile (current status, leaf condition, care schedule, sunlight preference, and temperature range), and a "Learn More" button for additional information.
